# Money Tracker API

This API allows users to track their finances by managing categories, balances, and transactions. The app supports basic operations like adding money (income), deducting money (expenses), and organizing these transactions into user-defined categories. The API is designed to work with multiple users, ensuring each user's financial data is isolated.
